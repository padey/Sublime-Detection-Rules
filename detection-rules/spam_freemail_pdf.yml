name: "Spam: Suspicious Short Email from Free-mail Domain with PDF Attachment"
description: |
    Detects inbound emails from either free-mail domains or non-whitelisted corporate domains that include only a PDF attachment (single or any PDF) and have fewer than 100 characters in the plain-text body. This minimal-text, PDF-only delivery is a common tactic for spam, unwanted commercial offers, and PDF-based phishing.
